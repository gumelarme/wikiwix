Wikiwix

A chrome extension that let you open wikipedia link in your local kiwix server.
Left click on a wikipedia (or any kiwix supported site in the future) and 
'Open it kiwix' options will be appeared in your context menu.

To some of you its maybe useless, but I live in china where wikipedia is blocked
by the Great Firewall, so kiwix is such a blessing. Kiwix uses 
zim wich is a dump file of a wiki site (for wikipedia-2018 its ~78Gb) its huge,
so searching for article become super slow. But because its a dump file 
its exactly the same as the original, so if you have the link to wikipedia article 
changing the domain name will lead to the same page in kiwix.
This extension provide that.

TODO:
- On/Off for rules.
- Create rules for every single site available in kiwix.
- A quick 'how to' in the option page.
